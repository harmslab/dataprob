# dataprob

Library for calculating the probability of data (the likelihood) to extract
parameter estimates for models describing experimental data. Can do maximum
likelihood, bootstrap, and Bayesian sampling using a consistent API.  

Docs in progress.  See `examples/example-fit.ipynb` for basic demonstration
of the API.
