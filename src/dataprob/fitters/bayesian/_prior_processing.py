def find_normalization(scale,rv,**kwargs):
    """
    This method finds an offset to add to the output of rv.logpdf that 
    makes the total area under the pdf curve 1.0. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    scale : float
        scale argument to scipy.stats.rv
    rv : rv_continuous
        object for calculating logpdf
    kwargs : dict
        kwargs are passed to rv_continuous to initialize

    Returns
    -------
    offset : float
        offset to add to frozen_rv.logpdf(x) to normalize pdf to 1.0 

    Notes
    -----

    Calculate the minimum difference between floats we can represent using our
    data type. This sets the bin width for a discrete approximation of the
    continuous distribution.

        res = np.finfo(dtype).resolution
    
    Calculate the sum of the un-normalized pdf over a range spanning zero. We
    use a range of -num_to_same*res -> num_to_sample*res, taking steps of res:

        frozen_rv = rv(loc=0,scale=scale,**kwargs)
        x = np.arange(-num_to_sample*res,
                      num_to_sample*(res + 1),
                      res)
        un_norm_prob = np.sum(frozen_rv.pdf(loc=x))

    Calculate the difference in the cdf between num_to_sample*res and 
    -num_to_sample*res. This is the normalized probability of the slice
    centered on zero we calculated above. 

        norm_prob = cdf(num_to_sample*res) - cdf(-num_to_sample*res). 

    The ratio of norm_prob and un_norm_prob is a scalar that converts from raw
    pdf calculations to normalized probabilities. 

        norm_prob_x = frozen_rv.pdf(x)*norm_prob/un_norm_prob

    Since we care about log versions of this, it becomes:

        log_norm_prob_x = frozen_rv.logpdf(x) + log(norm_prob) - log(un_norm_prob)

    We can define a pre-calculated offset;

        offset = log(norm_prob) - log(un_norm_prob) 

    So, finally:

        log_norm_prob_x = frozen_rv.logpdf(x) + offset

def find_uniform_value(bounds):
    """
    Find the log probability for a specific value between bounds to use in a 
    uniform prior. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    bounds : list-like, optional
        list like float of two values. function assumes these are non-nanf 
        floats where bounds[1] >= bounds[0]. If bounds is None, assume 
        infinite bounds. 
    
    The idea here is to find the maximum finite width the parameter can occupy
    (bound[1] - bound[0]) and then to divide that by the number of steps based 
    on our numerical resolution. If our resolution was 0.1 and we were between 
    0 and 1, there would be 11 values, so the uniform prior would be ln(1/11).
    The log prior ends up being: np.log(resolution/width)

    For finite bounds, this is:
    
        np.log(resolution) - np.log(upper - lower)

    For infinite bounds, this is:
        
        np.log(resolution) - (np.log(scalar) + log(max_positive_finite_float)).

    max_positive_finite_float is the largest number we can represent. scalar
    ranges (0,2]. It would be 2 for the bounds (-infinity,infinity), because 
    this covers a span 2*max_positive_finite_float. To avoid overflow, we 
    represent as logs (ln(2*max) --> ln(2) + ln(max)). Scalar values lower than
    2 represent smaller chunks of the finite number line. A value of 1 would 
    be half the number line (-infinity,0), (0,infinity). The value approaches
    zero for the bounds (-infinity, -infinity + resolution) and 
    (infinity - resolution,infinity).
